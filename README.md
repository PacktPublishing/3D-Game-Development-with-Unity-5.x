## About the Video Course


This course will take your Unity 5 knowledge to an advanced practical level; you'll build an action-packed 3D game and leverage the game framework you created. Throughout this game development you are going to take your Unity skills up a notch and learn how to create basic State Machines for your character entities, use Unity Physics to move things around, and learn how to create a Plugin for your Game Framework.

You'll start off the video course by creating your first project, a 3D game, where you'll begin with creating controllers, with an added camera. Once you've created cool weapons, you'll start spawning waves of enemies, and up the level of difficulty with each wave. You'll then add in audio, optimize your game, and then publish it. For your second project, you'll pick up one of the existing games and add the multiplayer feature to it, to add to the excitement!

This completely practical course will give you the skills and experience needed to broaden your game development techniques; you'll get to know the Unity engines like the back of your hand.
